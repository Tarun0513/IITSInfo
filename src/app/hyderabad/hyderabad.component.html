      <div class="AboutContent">
     <p style="text-indent: 80px;">IIT Hyderabad is one among the 2nd generation of IITs started by the Govt. of India. Today IITH offers 9 B.Tech programs, 16 M.Tech programs, 3 M.Sc programs, 5 M.Phil programs, 1 M.Des program and Ph.D. programs in all branches of engineering, science, liberal arts and design. The very foundation of IIT Hyderabad is based on research and innovation. The vibrant research culture is evident from the number of patents and publications that IITH has. At IITH students are given with a plethora of choices, which they diligently choose with the help of a faculty advisor. Courses that last for a semester are almost a foregone story at IITH. </p>
      
       <p style="text-indent: 120px;">. From 14-15 academic year onwards all B.Tech programs started offering courses that are of smaller credits; called the fractal academics; very carefully designed to keep the enthusiasm of the students and to keep them in pace with the state of the art from 1st semester till 8th semester. IITH in the past couple of years has been highly successful in building tie-ups with leading academic institutions around the globe. IITH enjoys a very special relationship with Japanese Universities and Industries that goes beyond academic and research collaborations. In fact, some of the iconic buildings in IITH campus will carry the signature of Japanese architecture. IITH is creating a unique holistic educational ecosystem that offers interactive learning, a highly, flexible academic structure, cutting-edge research, strong industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship. It is providing an environment wherein students and faculty are not afraid to translate their dreams into realities.  </p> 
      
       <p style="text-indent: 120px;">IIT Bombay is a residential institute with nearly 550 faculty, 8000 students and 1250 administrative & supporting staff and 
      is a self-contained campus located in a beautiful wooded land of about 250 hectares. It has established itself as a premier 
      centre for teaching, research and industrial consultancy in the country. </p> 
      
      <p style="text-indent: 120px;">The design philosophy of the logo is based on the two key words ‘Inventions and Innovations’, the foundation and vision of IIT Hyderabad. It is depicted using two i’s with common dot above them. These letters emanates outwards on either directions signifying expansion and growth of that knowledge. This reflects the core values of the institute where it fosters and facilitates in expanding ones intellectual ability, creativity, research and scientifi c discoveries. The identity is a symbolic representation of a person reading a book. This indicates imparting knowledge through quality education. The logo has also been envisaged with another deeper and philosophical meaning. The circle in the logo depicts the sun, the primary source of energy. The portrayal of sun symbolizes guiding light, force, creation, growth and strength. The warm and radiating colour scheme is derived from the vibrant sunlight (which also reflects the geographical climate of the city).</p>

       <p style="text-indent: 120px;">IIT Hyd Research Park is a self-reliant team endorsed by IIT Hyd and its alumni. The IIT Hyd Research Park promotes the betterment of research and development by the institute through friendship with industry, helping in the advancement of modern ventures, and buil-up economic development.

            <p style="text-indent: 120px;"> We are proud of preparing dynamic leaders, who make a difference to the world, with the skills that are nurtured here for a better tomorrow. As an institute that has completed only 11 years of its existence, it is gratifying to note that we are doing well and are almost on par with some of the first generation IITs. With the NIRF ranking of 8 among all the engineering institutes in the country and with QS Asia BRICS ranking of 94, we stand tall. This is essentially due to over 200 dynamic young faculty of the institute with an average age of 39, who work hard and take up challenges without the fear of failure, making IITH at the forefront of R&D innovations. A healthy faculty to student ratio of 1:14 and a good mix of UG and PG program with UG to PG to PhD ratio of 40:30:30, makes IITH a unique place for teaching and research.
          </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 120px;"> The strong research culture at IITH is reflected from around 500 sponsored research projects of Rs. 220 Crores that our faculty members have been handling currently. The number of Scopus indexed publications in the last 5 years are above 3400, which again reflects the thriving research activity. With a strong Japanese collaboration and the support from MHRD, the second phase infrastructure development is in its full swing and is expected to be completed by 2022. This is expected to give a big push to the research activity of the institute. IITH has a strong start up culture with dedicated space for incubation and research park. By the end of second phase we will have about 1.2 lakh sft of space each for the above two activities, which will boost the entrepreneurship activity significantly.
            </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 120px;"> The fractal academics with interdisciplinary approach, with departments such as AI, Climate Change, Engineering sciences provide a unique academic atmosphere at IITH. The BTech program in AI, a minor in entrepreneurship, Executive MTech in Data Science together with the Design and Liberal Arts departments represent the unique and diversified academic fabric. MTech in E-Waste Management & Recycling (together with C-MET) and Energy are some of the new programs being planned from the next academic year, which will add value to the existing academic program.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 120px;">  We are looking forward to strong collaborations, both academic and industrial, to help us grow stronger. Industry-R&D-Academia tie up on cutting edge technologies is the key for the growth of the country. IITH will play its part proactively in the near future in this direction. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 120px;">The campus life is improving on various fronts. The newly introduced mentoring of the students by faculty and alumni is expected to pump in positive energy into students’ lives. We have now a 24x7 hospital on the campus along with the support by specialist doctors visiting the campus regularly. The new supermarket, the 24x7 Nescafe and Amul outlet have made the life of the campus residents better.</p>
